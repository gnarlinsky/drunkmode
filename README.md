# *DRAFT*:
Custom UNIX commands to enable or disable "drunk mode."

**No guarantees on anything! Use at your own risk! This is beta!**


## General idea
Ever accidentally `rm *`'d something you shouldn't have because you were a
little inebriated (or very tired or extra stupid or what have you)?  Turn on
drunkmode to get extra prompts and warnings when carrying out the more
"dangerous" commands or actions.

## Affected commands

## Setting up:
* adding the 2 lines to bashrc or bashprofile
* copying the commands to usr/bin/
* may automate this process later

## Using it
Turn drunkmode on
``` bash
$ drunkmodeon
```
Turn drunkmode off
``` bash
$ drunkmodeoff
```

## Examples/see it in action
(Insert screenshots to show colors, or colorize the text)

## How it works
how works/env variable, bash_profile, etc

## Future/wishlist
* additional commands to change
* automate set up process
* see Issues
